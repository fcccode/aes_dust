<h4>AES-128 Block Cipher</h4>

<p>AES-dust is a compact Implementation of the AES-128 block cipher. There's support for Counter (CTR) and Electronic Codebook (ECB) modes of encryption.</p>

<p>The code is intentionally optimized for size rather than speed making it suitable for resource constrained environments.</p>

<h4>Side channel attacks</h4>

<p>AES was never intended to be resistant against side channel attacks. However, if you decide to use this code for an embedded project that requires a high level of security, first evaluate whether the code is sufficient against such attacks before using in your project.</p>

<h4>Files</h4>

<p>All files with .s and .asm extensions are compatible with the GNU assembler (GAS) except for the files in the MSVC folder that will assemble with either NASM or YASM.</p>
